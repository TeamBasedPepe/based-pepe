# Based Pepe
The official and verified smart contract of the Based Pepe token on Base.

The Boy’s Club have already run on Ethereum, but our friends at Based Brett have shown that the memecoin season on BASE has just begun – and Based $PEPE is here to take his rightful place on the throne.

Introducing Based $PEPE on the BASE chain, following the established Boy’s Club contract meta – on a contract starting with 0x52, right beside his pal Based Brett at 0x53.

No more pump fun and bonding curve derivatives. No more pre-sale tokens or token tax scams. Backed by the iconic power of Pepe, and standing at the forefront of retail on the BASE chain.

Based Pepe was launched quietly with no presale, zero taxes, locked LP, and a renounced contract – ensuring it remains a token for the people, forever.
